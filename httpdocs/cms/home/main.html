	I have been involved with several websites, getting my hands on just about every apect of a website, from setting up the web server to setting up the database to creating server-side pages to populate and retrieve data to designing the front-end that users view. In doing so, I have become familiar with various programming languages such as PHP, MySQL, MSSQL, HTML, and Javascript using tools such as CodeIgniter Framework, Zend Framework, Doctrine database helper, SVN Repository, JQuery javascript helper, Adobe Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Illustrator.

	I draw a lot of my inspiration from the energy of New York City. The peaceful bodies of water surrounding our little paradise, the buildings glistening in the sunlight, the still that can be found on a Brooklyn rooftop seeing the quiet expanse of a bustling city or right in the crowd of people rushing off to work or to party. The contrast between gritty Brooklyn and chichi Manhattan, the heated arguments for which is better. The millions of personalities that make up New York City is enough to feed your hungry brain with all the passion, beauty, pain and inspiration you could ever need.
