<p>Thornwood Cabinetry is a small custom cabinet shop. We also do renovations and new construction with an emphasis on kitchens and baths.</p><p>We are dedicated to providing the highest quality cabinetry, and woodwork needs. From small custom built-ins or pieces of furniture, to large kitchens and full home projects, and from the simple to the ornate, we work with you from the design process, all the way through to completion.</p>

<p>At large factories, where cabinets are built to stock sizes and finishes, there is no real care taken. We don't outsource any of our cabinetry or woodwork and we take care at every single step of the process. Whether it's laying out the perfect design, picking out complementary pieces of lumber for your project, or laying a beautiful finish down, we take pride and stand behind what we do.</p>

<p>We are a truly custom shop, any size, any style, any finish, if you or I can think it, we can build it. We can create seamless work in any space.</p>
<h3>Our Finishes:</h3>

<p>From the ornate, to the simple, we like to think our finishing process helps us stand out. We approach protecting and decorating your woodwork as an artform. We want you to immediately want to touch the woodwork and feel its character, or smoothness. We want your eyes to be mesmerized by the textures brought out in the wood with a good stain and shading lacquer. Only the highest quality finishes are used. Primarily, <a href="http://www.mlcampbell.com" target="blank">M.L. Campbell</a>, which produces an outstanding line of products, and which is in the absolute top of their field concerning all manner of finishes, as well as staying on the cutting edge of environmental responsibilities</p>

<h3>Our Materials:</h3>

<p>Another advantage we have to larger companies, is that we don't have to "penny pinch" with our materials. We don't do the same volume, and so we don't see any major appreciation over saving a few dollars on inferior products.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our plywood is always 3/4" plywood with wood veneer, as opposed to 1/2" particle core, or mdf, or melamine.</li>
	<li>Our drawers are always dovetailed and come typically standard with full extension, fully concealed, soft-close slides.</li>
	<li>Our doors come standard with fully concealed 120 degree soft close blum hinges.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staying Green:</h3>

<p>At Thornwood Cabinetry, we are always trying to become more energy efficient and environmentally conscious. Our best practice is to try and purchase as local as possible, keeping most of our spending in our own community. We are always striving to keep our work area as energy efficient as possible. We won't purchase any materials which are endangered or near endangered as a result of the loose forestry restrictions in other countries. Our finishing products are not only top quality in terms of durability, colorfastness, and other properties, but are also very "green" when compared to other companies' products. </p>
